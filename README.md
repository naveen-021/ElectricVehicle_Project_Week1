## 🎯 Week-1 Goals (Completed)

- ✅ Load & clean EV dataset  
- ✅ Parse battery & range fields  
- ✅ Handle missing values  
- ✅ Create numeric features  
- ✅ Simple Linear Regression model (battery → range)
- ✅ Generate predictions & basic plots  
- ✅ Insights + documentation  

### 📊 Key Result
EV range increases roughly **6 km per additional 1 kWh battery**.
